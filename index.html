   <h2> Mayuko's commentary on Software Engineering and how our course syllabus prepares us</h2>
   <p> In the video Mayuko described several characteristics and skills that are important to be a succesful Software Engineer.
     Our syllabus offers a plan to develop such attributes. These attributes are listed below.</p>
   <ul>
     <li> <h4> Collaborative work and soft skills </h4> </li>
<p> over the course of the video, mayuku stresses on the importance of human skills (soft skills) like the ability to work in collaboration 
  and the ability to communicate. She gives an example of how the product managers and designers brainstorm with the software engineers
  even for the ideas and how to implement them. She also stresses importance of code review and feedback culture, and how this "check" helps
  the engineers' code go through successfully with less time wasted on minor errors. She even goes as far as to say that these skills are as
  important as the technical skills.<br />
  Our course also reflects a plan that aims to develop similar skills. For human or soft skills development, our syllabus incorporates several
  strategies listed below.
  <ol>
    <li> showing up on time as a good etiquette, and not leaving early; instead, helping our partners out if they have their work left
      (alluding to empathy)</li>
    <li> Assignments to be done in pairs or groups which directly teaches collaboration skills.</li>
    <li> Pairing up with another person also helps make a better communicator.</li>
    <li> Lab work in pairs helps with time management as a team (division of labor/work) </li>
    <li> partners checking code and helping our peers with their code is also something that software engineers commonly practice and is
      also a form of collaborative work which our syllabus supports, in a controlled way. (we have to identify the person helping clearly)</li>

<ul>
  <li> <h4> Technical Skills </h4> </li>
  <p> Although Mayuko spent most of her time in the video explaining how important soft skills are for a software engineer, she did say that
    technical skills are almost just as important. These skills are a core part of our syllabus and are listed below: </p>
